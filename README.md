# 📰 Responsive News Website

This is a responsive news website project built using **HTML** and **CSS**.  
It was originally made as part of a Udemy course by **Sadık Turan**.  
While the general concept and layout are based on the course content, I wrote all the code myself and made several modifications and design improvements.
🎯 The goal was to create a clean, elegant, and modern news website layout that looks great on all screen sizes — especially optimized for mobile devices under `762px`.
